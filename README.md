# Multi-Health-Prediction
This repository contains the files for creating a multi health predictor.

## Dataset:
- Heart Failure Prediction: Dataset
- Diabetes Dataset: Dataset
- Breast Cancer: Dataset
-------------------

## Problem description:
Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and breast cancer are top 3 causes of death globally, taking millions of lives each year, which accounts for 50% of all deaths worldwide. We will be making a web application through which the user can add in their personal details and our trained models would be able to predict if the patient has one of the diseases mentioned below.

--------------

## Heart Failure:
Heart Failure Prediction contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk need early detection and management where a machine learning model can be of great help.

----- 

## Diabetes:
The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. It has the following features:
- Number of Instances: 768
- Number of Attributes: 8 plus class
- For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued)

----------------- 

## Breast Cancer:
Health is an essential aspect of everyoneâ€™s life. Breast cancer is found in the body of male or females when the cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumor and can be felt as a lump or could be seen on an x-ray. Cancer can be distinguished as benign, or either can be malignant (cancer). Dataset contains 31 features.

--------------------------

## Potential Methods:
It can be a supervised logistic regression to predict what kind of disease when the user input some symptoms. 
OR it can be an unsupervised learning clustering to find hidden correlation among some features.
